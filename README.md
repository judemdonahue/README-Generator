## Description
The README.md generator project is a command-line application that generates a high-quality README.md file for a GitHub repository. The project was built to simplify the process of creating a well-structured README file for any project. The problem that this project solves is the tedious and repetitive process of creating a README file for each project. This project allows developers to quickly generate a professional-looking README file with minimal effort. Through building this project, the developer can learn how to use various programming concepts such as file input and output, user input, and string manipulation. It also provides an opportunity to learn how to utilize external libraries or packages that can help simplify the code and add functionality.
